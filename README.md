# Learning Books

I'm planning on formalizing my learning journey by taking notes and making summaries of books related to computer science and software development. The goal is to build a clear, organized reference of key concepts and insights for long-term learning and to be able to look back and see my progress.

Each book will have its own subfolder containing notes, examples, and references, as relevant. 

## Structure
- **Grokking Algorithms/** â€” step-by-step breakdowns and explanations of core algorithms
- *(More books will be added over time)*

**To do list:**
- Grokking Data Structures
- System Design Interview (Vol 1 & 2)
- Cracking the Coding Interview
- The Imposter's Handbook
- Github - [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer?tab=readme-ov-file#study-guide) , [Presmihaylov booknotes](https://github.com/presmihaylov/booknotes/tree/master/system-design)
