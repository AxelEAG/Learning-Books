    "## **Factorial (n!)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The factorial of a number `n`, written as `n!`, is the product of all positive integers up to `n`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`n! = n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x ... x 2 x 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120`\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking closely at it, one can note how each factorial is build on top of the previous one. That is, there is a pattern:\n",
    "* `5! = 5 x 4!`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `4! = 4 x 3!`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `3! = 3 x 2!`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **The Recursive Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, for any `n`, we can write the factorial in terms of `n - 1`. This leads us to a recursive pattern, with the **recursive case** being:\n",
    "\n",
    "`n! = n x (n - 1)!`\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there must be a stopping point - a **base case**. In this case, by definition it's at n = 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "` 1! = 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together we have the recursive relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Base case: `1! = 1`\n",
    "* Recursive case: `n! = n x (n - 1)!`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorials are used in statistics, and other areas of mathematics — for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculating permutations and combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "* In binomial coefficients, probability formulas, and Taylor series expansions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Even in time complexities for some problems, like the previously introduced travelling merchant problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Algorithm Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a number _n_.\n",
    "2. Check for base case - return 1 if _n_ equals 1.\n",
    "3. Otherwise, apply recursive case - multiply _n_ by _factorial(n - 1)_\n",
    "4. Repeat process to find _n - 1_.\n",
    "\n",

    "| Type | Time | Space |\n",
    "|------|------|--------|\n",
    "| Iterative | O(n!) | O(1) |\n",
    "| Recursive | O(n!) | O(n) |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** For a given number _n_, the algorithm multiplies it by the factorial of the previous number _n - 1_. As such, it does n multiplications, leading to O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** \n",
    "* *Iterative:* O(1). Only uses a few fixed variables and no additional memory grows with input size, so space remains constant.\n",
    "* *Recursive:* O(n). The algorithm does n calls to itself, each leading to a new frame to the call stack, resulting in n stack frames in memory.\n"
