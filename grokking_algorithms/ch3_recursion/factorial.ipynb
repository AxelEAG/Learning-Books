    "## **Factorial (n!)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "The factorial of a number `n`, written as `n!`, is the product of all positive integers up to `n`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`n! = n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x ... x 2 x 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120`\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking closely at it, one can note how each factorial is build on top of the previous one. That is, there is a pattern:\n",
    "* `5! = 5 x 4!`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `4! = 4 x 3!`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `3! = 3 x 2!`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **The Recursive Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, for any `n`, we can write the factorial in terms of `n - 1`. This leads us to a recursive pattern - the **recursive case**:\n",
    "\n",
    "`n! = n x (n - 1)!`\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there must be a stopping point - a **base case**. In this case, by definition it's at n = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "` 1! = 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together we have the recusive relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Base case: `1! = 1`\n",
    "* Recursive case: `n! = n x (n - 1)!`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorials are used in combinatorics, probability, and mathematics — for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculating permutations and combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "* In binomial coefficients, probability formulas, and Taylor series expansions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Even in time complexities for some problems, like previously introduced travelling person. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Algorithm Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a number _n_.\n",
    "2. Check for base case - return 1 if _n_ equals 1.\n",
    "3. Otherwise, apply recursive case - multiply _n_ by _(n - 1)!_\n",
    "4. Repeat process to find _n - 1_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Time | Space |\n",
    "|------|------|--------|\n",
    "| Iterative | O(n!) | O(1) |\n",
    "| Recursive | O(n!) | O(n) |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** For a given number _n_, the algorithm multiplies it by the factorial of the previous number _n - 1_. As such, it does n multiplications, leading to O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Explanation**\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** For a given list of size n, every iteration reduces the search range in half. \n",
    "This gives the algorithm at most log_2(n) (or log n) iterations.\n",
    "Each of these iterations has a constant amount of operations x, totaling (log n) * x operations - or just log n for big-O notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** \n",
    "* *Iterative:* O(1). No data structures dependant on size were used so space is just constant\n",
    "* *Recursive:* O(log n). Have to look at auxiliary space and call stack space. In this case, auxiliary space (temporary space like variables) is just left, right, mid and val. So, it's O(1).\n",
    "However, call stack space, or recursion depth, is O(log n), as it splits the range in half, keeping the previous calls, until it finds the answer. In total, it's auxiliary * call stack = O(1) * O(log n) = O(log n)\n",
