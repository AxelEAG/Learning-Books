    "## **Binary Search**\n",
    "A search algorithm that, given a sorted list and a target value, repeatedly divides a sorted list in half,\n",
    "narrowing down the possible location of a target value until the value is found (or the range is empty).It returns the index of the target (or `None` if not found).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Case**\n",
    "Binary search is used when you need to efficiently find an element in a **sorted** list or array.\n",
    "It’s ideal for large datasets where a linear scan would be too slow, as it reduces the search space by half each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Algorithm Steps**\n",
    "1. Define the search range (`left` to `right`).\n",
    "2. Compute the midpoint of the range.\n",
    "3. Compare the midpoint value with the target.\n",
    "    - If target == midpoint → return the index.\n",
    "    - If target < midpoint  → search the left half.\n",
    "    - If target > midpoint  → search the right half.\n",
    "4. Repeat (steps 2-3) until the range is 1 element / it's not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Complexity**\n",
    "| Type | Time | Space |\n",
    "|------|------|--------|\n",
    "| Iterative | O(log n) | O(1) |\n",
    "| Recursive | O(log n) | O(log n) |\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Explanation**\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** For a given list of size n, every iteration reduces the search range in half. \n",
    "This gives the algorithm at most log_2(n) (or log n) iterations.\n",
    "Each of these iterations has a constant amount of operations x, totaling (log n) * x operations - or just log n for big-O notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** \n",
    "* *Iterative:* O(1). No data structures dependant on size were used so space is just constant\n",
    "* *Recursive:* O(log n). Have to look at auxiliary space and call stack space. In this case, auxiliary space (temporary space like variables) is just left, right, mid and val. So, it's O(1).\n",
    "However, call stack space, or recursion depth, is O(log n), as it splits the range in half, keeping the previous calls, until it finds the answer. In total, it's auxiliary * call stack = O(1) * O(log n) = O(log n)\n"
